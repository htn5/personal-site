Happy Cows was originally a game created for the UCSB Chemistry department to teach its students about population control and carrying capacity.

My class was tasked to work on the game and add new features. In order to do this, we were required to understand, analyze, and edit legacy code. At the end of the quarter, I had integrated new controllers into the backend that worked with the new components that my teammates and I had created. We pushed more than eight new enhancements to the web application. This project really helped me understand Agile workflows and solidfied my knowledge of GitHub.
