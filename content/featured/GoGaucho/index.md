GoGaucho was developed by former students of UCSB for students of UCSB. It can be used to plan out future classes, to find UCSB classroom buildings, and to check the dining hall menus among many other things. We currently have ~4,000 daily users. I am currently working on improving the schedule display on the iOS app.
